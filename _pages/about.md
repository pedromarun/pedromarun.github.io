I am a postdoctoral researcher in Set Theory at the Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences. I got my PhD in 2024 from Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor was James Cummings. 

I'm interested in forcing, infinitary combinatorics and applications of set theory to analysis and topology.
